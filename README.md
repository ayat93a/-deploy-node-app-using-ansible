🛠️ Real Life Ansible Scenario for You:
________________________________________
📋 Scenario:
You are working as a DevOps engineer in a company.
The development team just finished a new Node.js web app.
They want you to automate the deployment to a new Ubuntu server.
Your mission is to write an Ansible playbook that does:
________________________________________
🖥️ 1. Install the needed system packages:
•	Install Node.js (use the official NodeSource repo, not the old Ubuntu one).

•	Install PM2 globally to manage the Node.js app.

 ### I use node js artifact for the project https://github.com/ayat93a/nodeJs-app-for-testing.git
________________________________________
📂 2. Prepare the environment:
•	Create a Linux user called nodeApp

•	Make sure nodeApp has a home directory and can run PM2 apps

•	Allow passwordless sudo only for service management commands (like restart nginx).
________________________________________
📦 3. Deploy the application:
•	Clone the app from this GitHub repo:
https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample.git
### i crete artifact for https://github.com/ayat93a/nodeJs-app-for-testing.git and copy it form the control node to the managed node
•	Place it inside /home/nodeApp
________
🏃 4. Start the app with PM2:

•	Start the app as the nodeApp user using PM2

•	Make sure PM2 auto-starts on server reboot (hint: pm2 startup)
________________________________________
🛡️ 5. Secure the server:
•	Install fail2ban to protect against SSH attacks

•	Configure UFW (firewall) to allow only:

o	Port 22 (SSH)

o	Port 80 (HTTP)

•	Enable UFW
________________________________________
⚙️ 6. Bonus (Optional but High Value):

•	Set the timezone of the server to UTC

•	Make sure node and npm versions are printed at the end of the playbook (as a check)
