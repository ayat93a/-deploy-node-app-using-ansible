🛠️ Real Life Ansible Scenario for You:
________________________________________
📋 Scenario:
You are working as a DevOps engineer in a company.
The development team just finished a new Node.js web app.
They want you to automate the deployment to a new Ubuntu server.
Your mission is to write an Ansible playbook that does:
________________________________________
🖥️ 1. Install the needed system packages:
•	Install Node.js (use the official NodeSource repo, not the old Ubuntu one).
•	Install PM2 globally to manage the Node.js app.
________________________________________
📂 2. Prepare the environment:
•	Create a Linux user called webadmin
•	Make sure webadmin has a home directory and can run PM2 apps
•	Allow passwordless sudo only for service management commands (like restart nginx).
________________________________________
📦 3. Deploy the application:
•	Clone the app from this GitHub repo:
https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample.git
•	Place it inside /opt/webapp
•	Change ownership to webadmin
________________________________________
🏃 4. Start the app with PM2:
•	Start the app as the webadmin user using PM2
•	Make sure PM2 auto-starts on server reboot (hint: pm2 startup)
________________________________________
🛡️ 5. Secure the server:
•	Install fail2ban to protect against SSH attacks
•	Configure UFW (firewall) to allow only:
o	Port 22 (SSH)
o	Port 80 (HTTP)
•	Enable UFW
________________________________________
⚙️ 6. Bonus (Optional but High Value):
•	Set the timezone of the server to UTC
•	Make sure node and npm versions are printed at the end of the playbook (as a check)
